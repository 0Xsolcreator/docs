Hello, This is 0xCreator (anon version of me in the internet capitals)

I'm working on documenting basic setups involving React Native integration with SOLANA and its ecosystem protocols.
So if you are a RN nerd looking for some solana integrations then you might find this documentation helpful.

If you are just getting started with React Native development, then you should consider the 
[official RN documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started?guide=android) as the starting point.

Please fell free to contribute to the documentation for new integrations or to correct my existing writings.
